to understand the competition and improve their marketing strategy and the research
and development department. The datasets include a list of facemasks available on an
online store along with information about the product, price, ratings, and list of
consumer reviews for these face masks.
## Steps Followed :

3. A report summarizing the analysis and its implications for the client's business
strategy
